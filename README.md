# Ziver: The Open Hack MVP

![Ziver Logo](https://place-your-logo-url-here.com/logo.png) **Ziver is a pioneering multi-blockchain platform built on TON, designed to transform user engagement into tangible value through a gamified Telegram Mini App (TMA).**

Our MVP for **The Open Hack** focuses on creating a sustainable, monetized engagement loop within the TON ecosystem, introducing a unique "Social Capital" concept that rewards users for their activity and reputation.

## üöÄ Hackathon MVP Features

Our submission showcases a fully functional backend API, a secure TON smart contract, and a clear, user-centric vision.

* **‚ú® Gamified ZP Mining:** Users can effortlessly start mining Ziver Points (ZP) in 4-hour cycles, claim their rewards, and use ZP to upgrade their mining capabilities (speed, capacity, duration).
* **‚úÖ Interactive Task System:** A dynamic list of tasks that users can complete to earn bonus ZP. This includes in-app actions ("Maintain a 3-day streak") and external tasks ("Follow a partner on Twitter"), all designed to boost ecosystem growth.
* **üíº Micro-Job Marketplace with On-Chain Escrow:**
    * **Post & Complete Jobs:** TON projects and users can post small, verifiable tasks, paying directly in TON.
    * **Secure Escrow:** All job funds are held in a secure FunC smart contract on the TON blockchain.
    * **Automated Expiry:** The contract includes an auto-expiry feature to refund posters if a task is not completed in time.
    * **Dispute Resolution:** A moderator role is built-in to handle and resolve disputes fairly.
* **üèÜ Social Engagement Badge:** We introduce a simplified version of our "Social Capital Score." A user's score visibly increases with every task completion, mining claim, and daily check-in, demonstrating our core vision of turning participation into measurable, on-chain reputation.
* **üîê Secure User Authentication:** The system includes robust user registration and login, complete with **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** for enhanced security.
